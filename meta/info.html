    <P>This project template is the basis of a mechanical keyboard based on the
        <A HREF="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f303.html" TARGET="blank">STM32F303 microcontroller, an ARM Cortex M4 core with FPU and DSP instructions.</A> <BR><BR>This base project includes a basic schematic with the essential connections made between components. This template includes a schematic for RGB LED underglow, ESD protection circuit, per-switch LED support, as well as jumpers for connecting directly to the MCU.
